                ## Project Goal
                The goal of this project is to programatically create quality README.md files from user inputs.
                ## Lessons Learned
                I learned how to utilize the inquirer and file system modules and how to properly implement template literals.
                ## Project Challenges
                I had challenges trying to determine what parts of the readme I could create into templates.
                ## Installation
                From the command line Interface enter <npm install> <npm install fs> <npm install inquirer>. Then run the application with <node index>.
